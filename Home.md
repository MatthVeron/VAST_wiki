# Overview
Welcome to the wiki for the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) model.

I post most materials regarding `VAST` on the wiki of its main dependency, package `SpatialDeltaGLMM`, and [please see materials here](https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/geostatistical_delta-GLMM/wiki).  However, I will add materials to the `VAST` wiki that apply only to `VAST`.

## Features specific to VAST

1.  Simulator:  VAST includes a feature to simulate new data sets, see [here](https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST/wiki/Simulator)

2.  Species interactions:  VAST also includes options to estimate species interactions (the impact of population density for species X on per-capita productivity for species Y), see instructions [here](https://github.com/James-Thorson/VAST/wiki/Species-interactions-in-VAST)
