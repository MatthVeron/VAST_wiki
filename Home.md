# Overview
Welcome to the wiki for the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) model.

I post most materials regarding `VAST` on the wiki of its main dependency, package `SpatialDeltaGLMM`, and [please see materials here](https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/geostatistical_delta-GLMM/wiki).  However, I will add materials to the `VAST` wiki that apply only to `VAST`.

## Steering committee

Updates to `VAST` will be planned with input from a Steering Committee.  The Steering Committee will include Jim Thorson and three rotating members, where each rotating member will serve as long as they have time and interest, and new members will be identified as needed by existing committee members.  Member duties will be:
* some occasional discussion (<1 per month) regarding any externally suggested modifications (i.e., through the issue tracker), to prioritize which are important vs. could be postponed or ignored.
* availability and effort to help brainstorm changes, perhaps 1-3 times per year.

Current members are:
* Jim Thorson
* Christine Stawitz
* Cole Monnahan
* Eric Ward
