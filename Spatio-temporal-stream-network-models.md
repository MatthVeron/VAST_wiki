# Multivariate spatio-temporal models on stream networks

It is possible to use `VAST` to use all existing features (including multivariate models, MICE models, models involving multiple modes of data, etc) when modeling correlations via distance along a stream network in place of Euclidean distance. I will post example data once a current paper is accepted for publication, but feel free to email me (James Thorson) directly to discuss the idea earlier.
